# Radar
Course work on the course "Programming on microcontrollers" - "Radar" group â„–5921

The objective of this course work is to develop and create a Radar, a device that signals a light and sound signal about approaching closer than 50 centimeters, using an ultrasonic rangefinder that determines the distance to objects in the area of 180 degrees.

There are modules: Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic rangefinder, stepper motor, LED module, Sound emitter, housing.

The work program is loaded into the Arduino, so the device will start working immediately after power is applied.

If an object appears in the device's field of view, within a radius of 50 cm, a light and sound signal will be sent.
